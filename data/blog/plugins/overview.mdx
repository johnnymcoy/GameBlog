# Introduction

When creating my game, I got to a point where I realised that if I wanted to reuse some of the features that I had build,
such as a heath bar, I'd have to rewrite a lot of the code I had already done to make sure it fits into another project.

I started looking into making each part of my project reuseable, and seperated into different modules(Plugins).
This created quite a slow down in my progress, but would be worth it in the long run, as now when I start a new project I can easily just add features from the plugins i've created.
This segregation also helps with making the project more efficent, and not having too many dependencies.

# Plan

Each week I'll be posting a blog post on a different plugin.
My hope is to get them to a well working stage, then to add them to the Unreal Marketplace for free.

Having them on the Marketplace will help grow my followers, and help evolve the plugins futher with fan requested features.
