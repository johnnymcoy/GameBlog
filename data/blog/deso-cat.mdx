# Introduction

This is a quick game made in 48hrs as a part of the 'Game Makers tool kit' Game Jam, 
The theme was 'Joined together' so I deciced to make a game where you control a 
pet and try to get your owner home. 
You dodge traffic, jump around all while your owner is being dragged on the floor, 
losing health with every hit.
The game is buggy and unbalanced but a great 
learning experience and a lot of fun
