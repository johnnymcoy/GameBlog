# Minigames

Not everything in Space Plunder is solved with guns and brute force.
Sometimes you’ll need to work your way past a locked door, crack a security terminal, or pass a tricky skill check. That’s where minigames come in.

They’re short, skill-based challenges that pop up in the middle of your game. Get them right, and you’re rewarded with progress.
Fail, and doors stay locked, alarms might sound, and enemies might notice.

# The Three Types

## Hacking

Used for terminals, doors, or security systems.
You’re presented with a grid of digits (or letters).
The correct sequence is hidden among the noise, and you’ll have to pick carefully before the system locks you out.

Starts simple but ramps up with speed, decoys, and fewer mistakes allowed.
Think of it as a puzzle where pattern recognition and timing matter.

## Timed Challenges

Perfect for locks, quick repairs, or reaction-based checks.
A moving cursor sweeps around a circular meter, and you have to stop it inside the target zone.
Hit the sweet spot for a perfect success.
Land close and you’ll still pass, but with reduced effectiveness.
Overshoot completely? You fail the attempt.

## Rhythm (WIP)

A future addition for musical or flow-based actions.
You’ll line up button presses with beats or animations—whether that’s bypassing alien tech, syncing with ship systems, or some more lighthearted diversions.

# Why they matter

Immersion: Instead of just pressing “Use,” you’re actively cracking codes, forcing locks, or timing your moves.

Variety: Breaks up the flow of combat and exploration with quick, focused gameplay.

Consequences: Passing or failing directly affects the world—doors stay shut, alarms blare, or loot stays locked away.

Replayability: Different difficulty levels keep things fresh, from easy “tutorial” style challenges to near-impossible high-stakes hacks.

Where you’ll see them

Hackable doors and terminals

Lockpicking and safes

Ship or vehicle repairs under pressure

Skill checks for persuasion, intimidation, or finesse

Roadmap

Add the Rhythm minigame with music-synced challenges.

More visual variety: different themes for pirate locks vs. corporate systems.

Rewards scaling: perfect scores yield better loot or bonuses.

Accessibility tweaks like timing assists and color-blind friendly indicators.
