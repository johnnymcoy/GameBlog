# Dialogue System

This system builds ontop of the Interaction System I have to let Characters have text conversations with each other.
Most of the UI elements were borrowed from an existing Dialogue System: "Defender: Animated Dialogue", but when going
through that project I found it lacking a lot of features.
So I decided to create my own version.

My Dialogue System Currently Contains:

- Dialogue between two Characters
- In Game Dialogue bubbles (Not full screen)
- Allosw dropping items into the game world.
- Communicates changes to the HUD.

# Key Features

#### Dialogue Screen

When your character talks to another character, a full screen dialogue menu is visible. Player movement is stopped, and sound and character images are shown.

#### In-World Dialogue Bubbles

Intead of only seeing dialogue when in a full screen UI, NPCs can simply chat with small dialouge bubbles about there head.

  </div>
</div>

#### Branching Options

There are “requirements” for certain lines to show up. For instance, if the player’s trust level is high enough,
a new dialogue option appears. Or if they’re carrying a special item, they can unlock a unique response.
All of this is defined in a simple spreadsheet-like table that non-programmers can edit.

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">

  </div>
</div>
#### Voice & Sound Integration Whenever a line of dialogue appears, the system can play a matching sound
cue or voice clip. This lets you add personality to NPCs without having to tweak low-level code or manually
trigger audio events each time.

# Next Steps and Improvements

#### Multiplayer-Ready

    The Dialogue System is currently not Replicated.

#### Saving/Loading

    Implement Saving and Loading Logic so that dialogue options carry over between play sessions.

#### Dialogue Triggered Events

    Have events that can be triggered once a dialogue is comeplete, i.e. A character dies after talking to them.

#### UI Design

    Create proper UI for Inventory with Grid Layout
