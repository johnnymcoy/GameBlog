# Inventory Component

This component is designed to integrate seamlessly with other gameplay systems,
broadcasting events to both UI elements and networked clients when inventory changes occur.
Imagine the “inventory” in a game as a backpack or toolbox that holds everything your character carries, like weapons, health packs, crafting materials, or keys.
An inventory component simply:

- Keeps track of every item the player has collected.
- Handles picking up new items when the player finds them in the world.
- Allows dropping items into the game world.
- Communicates changes to the HUD.

# Key Features

#### Picking Up Items

When your character touches or interacts with an item in the world (a health pack on the ground, a dropped weapon, etc.),
the component asks “Is it okay to pick this up?” If yes, it adds that item to the internal list.

#### Dropping Items

If you decide you no longer need something, or want to give it to someone else,
the component takes that item out of your “backpack” and actually spawns it back into the world.

#### Selecting Items

Many games let you cycle through your items (for example, choosing between a gun, a grenade, or a healing potion).
The inventory system keeps track of which item is “active” so the character knows exactly what to use next.

#### Weight & Capacity (Optional)

In some games, you can’t carry unlimited items, you might have a weight limit or a maximum number of slots.
This component can be extended to check those rules before allowing you to pick something up.

#### User Interface Updates

As soon as you add, remove, or change which item you’ve selected, the component sends out a simple “inventory changed” signal.
A separate UI widget listens for that signal and instantly refreshes what you see.

#### Multiplayer-Ready

Just place items in the world, let players collect or drop them, and the component makes sure everyone sees the same thing.

# Next Steps and Improvements

#### Saving/Loading

    Implement Saving and Loading Logic so that inventories carry over between play sessions.

#### Weight & Grid Checks

Consult maximum allowed weight and slot count, to decide whether the player can pick up a given item.

#### UI Design

    Create proper UI for Inventory with Grid Layout
