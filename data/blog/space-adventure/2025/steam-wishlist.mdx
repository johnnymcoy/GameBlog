# Wishlist Now

After launching a public demo earlier in the year, I wanted to release it online for more people to try.
However, there were several areas I felt needed improvement first.
Players at home will most likely try the single-player mode,
where they may be more sensitive to bugs or poor mechanics.

After resolving most bugs and reaching a stable version,
I realized the demo still needed more replayability.
Playing the same ship level repeatedly can get dull,
so I implemented a procedural generation system to create varied ship layouts.
With this enhancement, Iâ€™ve decided to release the demo on Steam.
