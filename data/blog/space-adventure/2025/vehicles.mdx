# Getting around the galaxy

Space is big.
In Space Plunder you’ll need to hop between outposts, ships, and your mothership using a mix of cars, hovercraft, and small ships.
Each one feels and controls differently.

# Vehicle Types

#### Cars

Built for the ground. Great for crossing large stretches of planet surface with a friend or two.

#### Hovercrafts

Low-altitude gliders that skim terrain. They self-stabilize, so you can thread canyons and slide along valley floors without wrestling the controls.

#### Small Ships (Landers)

Your shuttle between the planet and your main ship in orbit. They fly with smooth, jet-like steering and keep your momentum pointed where the nose is, so turns feel clean rather than floaty.

## Cars

High-speed impacts can knock enemies over and deal damage, slow hits just push them aside.

## Hover

Hovercrafts auto-dampen sideways drift so you don't keep spinning in circles.

## Ships

Ships subtly re-orient your speed toward where you’re pointing, keeping momentum feeling right.
