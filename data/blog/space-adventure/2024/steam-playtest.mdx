# Public Demo Playtest

After launching a public demo earlier in the year, I wanted to release it online for more people to try.
However, there were several areas I felt needed improvement first. 
Players at home will most likely try the single-player mode, 
where they may be more sensitive to bugs or poor mechanics.

After resolving most bugs and reaching a stable version, 
I realized the demo still needed more replayability. 
Playing the same ship level repeatedly can get dull, 
so I implemented a procedural generation system to create varied ship layouts. 
With this enhancement, I’ve decided to release the demo on Steam.

## Steam Playtest

To enhance replayability, I’ve added a few more features to the demo.

The demo now features an end-game score that players can submit to a public Steam leaderboard.

Steam will also track various stats, which can unlock achievements.

By pressing F5, players can submit a feedback form to report bugs or provide general feedback.

The randomly generated levels are based on a seed, 
allowing players to replay specific levels or share them with friends.

Online co-op is functional, but since it hasn’t been fully 
tested with other players, I expect there will still be 
several bugs to address
