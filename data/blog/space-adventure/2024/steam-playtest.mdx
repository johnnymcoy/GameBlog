# Public Demo Playtest

Following the a great tutorial series on youtube,
I was able to code a Procedural Generation system that could easily create an endless amount of ship layouts.

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  <div>
    ![A low poly Character looking at a weapon on the ground, a floating UI element is above it
    showing the player that they can pick up the
    weapon.](/static/images/blog/spaceAdventure/2024/Demo_02_splitscreen.webp)
