Current List of Weapon Attachments include:

- Lights
- Knifes
- Suppressors/Silencers
- Optics
- Magazines
- & More

All modify the base stats of the weapon with attachments like Knifes adding to the melee damage, Optics adding accuracy, and Magazines increasing the Clip Size and Max Ammo.

## Stealth Takedowns

Stealth Takedowns have been added.
When the player is undetected they are able to perform a Stealth Takedown behind an NPC.
The player can choose between Lethal and non-Lethal.

The player can also choose to hide bodies from being found.

I've added in a way for the player to "Grab" physics objects and move them around, this way if players want to remain hidden they will have to hide any bodies.

This also works on characters who have just been knocked out, or fallen over, which results in funny scenarios or characters waking up while being held in the air.

## Interaction Button Prompts

The old method I had for interacting with objects involved the character having to be aiming, and having the crosshair directly over the object.

This would make it not clear how to interact, and what objects where interactable.

Moving away from the old method the new method involes showing prompts when the player is close to an interactable object and having a progress bar for interacting to prevent accidental pickups.
