# Creating A Demo

I’ve been working on a small, 
single-level demo to showcase the progress I've made on the game.

The demo begins with your character aboard an enemy ship. 
You have several different objectives to complete, such as 
eliminating everyone on board to steal the ship or freeing 
hostages and escorting them to an escape pod.

## Demo Features

The demo features stealth mechanics like 
avoiding security cameras, 
sneaking past guards, 
and performing silent takedowns.

There are four hostages aboard who need rescuing, and once freed, 
they can follow your commands. You can order them to help attack 
the ship or guide them safely to escape pods.
Additionally, automatic turrets will need to be disabled 
to successfully escape in an escape pod.

## Split-Screen Co-op

The demo supports two-player split-screen, 
as some online functionalities aren’t fully implemented yet. 
I’ve also configured controls and button prompts for Xbox controllers, 
allowing two players to play on a single PC.
