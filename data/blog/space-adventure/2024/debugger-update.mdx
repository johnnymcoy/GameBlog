# Creating Visual Debuggers

As the project grows, it becomes increasingly difficult 
to debug and pinpoint the source of issues, especially in multiplayer. 
To address this, I started developing additional tools to streamline 
the in-game debugging process.

## The Tools

While the engine includes basic debugging tools, 
I explored them further and began developing custom tools of my own.

One tool I developed is a simple extension that allows me to 
select which actor to debug, represented by a visual box in 3D space.

I also created a tool that displays all the variables of my shooting component, 
both locally and on the server. This makes it easier to identify which 
variables aren't being correctly synchronized for different players.
