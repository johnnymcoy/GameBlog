## How it went 
Having a public demo was a great experience. 
Having so many people play my game, (who have only heard very little about it), was very rewarding. 
People were impressed with the amount of work put in, the fact there was Splitscreen, and loved the style of it.


## What I learnt 

#### 
Having people enjoy watching the game, is also a good quailty to have. 


#### People are a lot more forgiving of bugs that I thought they wouldn't be.
Enemies spawning in walls, doesn't matter, people found it funny.


#### But not forgiving with not being told information.
Nobody liked not knowing what the reload button was. 
No one liked having to figure out the hacking minigame that was very last minute.

#### Everybody loves playing with a friend. 
Everyone playing in Co-op would be having 10x more fun. 


## Feedback 

Controller Prompts 
AI could hear through walls 
Everyone would shoot to test the controls, setting of the AI before even starting the game.
Unclear objectives. 
To hard.
Turrets should change color when disabled.
When a room is hacked/taken over, it should change color.
Reload button was annoying. 
Visual of Shield Damage on enemies. 
Hard to tell when low health. 
Co-op should have a waypoint for Player 2.
Low Health Indication. 
Anything that had health and didn't have a health bar was confusing to players. 
Not sure when things are dead (Turrets)
Doors should be lockable
Locked Prompt so people know it's locked. 

No Indication of score/credits.
