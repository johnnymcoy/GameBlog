# Procedural Generation 

Following the a great tutorial series on youtube, 
I was able to code a Procedural Generation system that could easily create an endless amount of ship layouts. 

The system works by spawning a specified number of rooms, in a random pattern. 


## Options

AI Spawn points 
Weapon Spawns 
Loot Spawns
Door Spawns

Stairs
Special Rooms

Random Seeds
