# Creating Different Gravity Options

Since the game is set in space, I wanted to offer a variety of gravity options to enhance gameplay.

## How Gravity will be controlled

Each ship will have its own simulated gravity,
and players will have the option to disable artificial gravity,
turning the entire ship into a zero-G environment.

Each ship will also feature an **airlock**, which can be hacked and opened,
sending objects and people flying into space.
Locked doors will prevent rooms from being depressurized.

## Getting around in Zero G

Players will have access to spacesuits and small jetpacks to maneuver in zero gravity.
If a room is depressurized, any player with a spacesuit in their inventory will automatically equip it.
