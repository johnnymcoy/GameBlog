# August Update

## Interactable outlines

To help the player know what items can be interacted with,
I've added an outline when they player is hovered over the item while aiming.
This is made on a simple post process material, which means each item doesn't need to be modified.

## Aim Assist

Aim Assist has been added in mainly to help with controller users and people who aren't as skilled at precise aiming.
Taking some insperation from games like Red Dead Redemption 2, when you hold the aim button down at a character, your camera will lock on to them.

## Multiplayer Modes & Kill Feed

A base multiplayer mode has been created, adding in Teams, a Score HUD, and a killfeed.
The killfeed gets the players Usernames, as well as how they died, which will be respresented with an icon between the names.

## Steam Multiplayer

Current the game is working online over Steam as well as Epic Online Servies.
Some more testing will be needed before I can start sending out demos.
