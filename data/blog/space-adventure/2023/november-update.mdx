# November Update

## Documentation

Game Design Documentation

As this project gets larger and larger, it's hard to keep track of all the moving parts.
I found online a free tool that generates documentation and even includes graphs of inheritance.
This will make the project easier to follow and figure out if someone else was to help.

## Character Traits

Each character now has Skills/Traits.
These skills are able to be Leveled up by the player, and are able to be set to higher levels for NPCs.
This will create more varied NPCs and combat encounters.

Players can get XP and each time they level up they can Upgrade 1 level of a skill, with each skill maxing out at 10.

The Skills so far are:

- Strength
- Perception
- Endurace
- Charisma
- Intelligence
- Agility
- Weapon Skill
- Stealth
- Luck
