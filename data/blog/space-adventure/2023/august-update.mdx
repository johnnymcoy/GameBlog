# July Update

## Thumbnails

I created an in-game camera that can take thumbnail pictures.
It has an empty level where you load which item you want a thumbnail of, and render out a 2D texture.

This saves time going into a photo editing program and creating each thumbnail one by one.

--- ## AI Patrol Points AI now can follow paths. The paths can also be bridged to other paths. Each path
point can have a certain time for the AI to wait till they move to the next. The AI can also go forward
or down the path depending on how many points they've passed.

--- ## Detection Meter Once the AI can see the player, a Detection meter will start to fill up, once
filled, the AI will become hostile. If the player leaves the view of the AI, if not detected, the meter
will then start to empty. If the meter was over 75% when the player left the view, the AI will investigate
what they saw.
