# September Update

## Teams & Respawning

In multiplayer matches, players are now automaticly sorted into teams.
Each spawn point is associated with a team and the team is spawned in after the "pre-match" timer has ended.
When players die, they respawn after a given time, depending on if it was an enemy or team kill.

## Scoreboard

The scoreboard contains all the multiplayer match details.
Player XP, kills, assists, deaths, kill/death ratio and the players ping.
The Current player is highlighted in blue.
On the left of all the players stats is a Team summary, with the team score, goal score and team name.

## Recoil Animation

After stumbling on the marketplace item "Shooter Recoil Animation", I found it would fit well within my project.
It's an easy to implement plugin, which saves a great amount of time on animations.
