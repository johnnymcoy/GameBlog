# December Update

## Weapon Updates

### Damage Numbers

Adding to the hitmarkers are damage numbers.
Originally just added to help with debugging how much damage each weapon was doing, it is quite a trend at the moment that people like.
I'm unsure if i'll keep these in the final game.

### Fire Modes

New fire modes have been added to the weapons.
Before only full auto and single fire were available.
Now Burst fire and Charged fire are available, creating more possibilites and variation with different weapons.

### Damage Range

Weapons also now take the range into account when applying damage.
So when the player is really close to an NPC they will get the full damage amount, and the futher they move away, the more the damage will falloff.

### Crosshairs

Dynamic Crosshairs have been added, which change to each individual weapon.
The reticle will be the calcualted bullet spread, and when moving will change as your accuracy changes.

## Menu Modals + Fixes

I've added in Online & Offline Profiles, which feature player stats, save games and more.
GameMode Rules and Scoring has been made more simple so that it can be customized by the player when choosing a level.
Players can Host and Join Lobbies instead of having to join directly into a match.

## Quest System Overhall

Going back through the Quest System with new eyes I was able refactor a lot of the code into much more readable and simple functions.
I've also added in Timed Objectives, the ability to fail Objectives by doing them incorrectly, (eg. Killing a team member during a quest) & ore.
